4	Thank you thank you thank you !! I  want to thank the people that made this place happen ....you have made all my dreams come true. Imagine a delicious yogurt shop with super fun flavors like peanut butter, chocolate mint, cake batter and so many more.  I used to have to travel to  Yogurtland or Jujuberry  but not anymore , now we have one right in the hood!! Guess what?   instead of eating a normal lunch I can pig out with a healthy peanut butter yogurt smothered in chocolate chips.   Could be the perfect lunch!!  See you there!
5	A Humane Society store at the Biltmore?  Interesting.  I had seen an adorable chihuahua mix at the Humane Society's webpage, and headed over to check out the little dog and the store.  They sell a variety of toys, treats, leashes, collars, and foods- in short, they sell a little bit of everything.  There's no tax, and if you adopt a pet from them they will give you 10% off the price as a thank you.  When I went there were 4 dogs up for adoption, a rabbit, and a wall of cats.  The little chihuahua mix was hanging out in the store with another little dog, so we got to play with them for a little bit.  The staff were friendly, and weren't pushy or hovering.  \n\nIn the end, we did end up adopting that little chihuahua mix from here.  He's the sweetest little dog ever.  Thank you Petique!
1	Don't buy Nike sneakers if you want to return or exchange them.. I've bought many from them. I went this week  and bought 2 pairs of Nike SB's that were already over retail price as it is.. I tried on one side then bought them... When I got home I realized that one of the shoes were damaged.. It's only been 2 days and they said they can't take it back.. I've bought many shoes there and this will be the last time... I'm from Nor Cal and people are crazy about sneakers out there and all the shops will accept a return or exchanged within 14- 30 days.. This was the first place that does not do that.. Why? Because sneakers and SB's are not big in AZ... They don't sell here.. I wouldn't buy them there if I were you.
